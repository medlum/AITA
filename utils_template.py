        - Availability : 9am - 5pm, Monday to Friday
        Study mode
        - Consists of online asynchronous learning, in-person learning and online synchronous learning.
        - Online asynchronous learning (OAL) will take place on the first and the fourth week of the course. Students are expected to study in their own time and complete workshop exercises as part of the assessments.
        - In-person learning (IPL) will take place on the 27 April and 20 May, 
        - Online synchronous learning (OSL) will take place of on 2 May and 10 June. Students are expected to attend online lessons with the trainer in Microsoft Teams.
      

        Learning location
        - In-person learning will take place in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Block 72, 01-01
        - Online asynchronous learning (OSL) will take place on Microsoft Teams
        - Microsoft Teams link for OSL  https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZWI2Mzk2NDQtZjQzYS00MGJmLWEyMTYtZjRhMmFiYzhlZDc4%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cba9e115-3016-4462-a1ab-a565cba0cdf1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221a7167d5-74b0-44c9-a08b-8de0243220b8%22%7d

        Learning materials
        - The learning materials are available in Google Colab: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GBtVW1UFvRNLFZ9glgvxd0yBGZa-vja2?usp=drive_link
        - Use these notebooks for the first week's learning
            - 1-huggingface-guide.ipynb
            - 2-Introduction-NLP.ipynb
            - 3-workshop-exercises-part-1.ipynb 


        TODOs on online asynchronous learning (OAL) for the first week:
        - Sign up for a Hugging Face account to obtain an access token, which will be used to access pre-trained AI models throughout the course.
        - Set up Hugging Face Hub in Google Colab.
        - Study Natural Language Processing (NLP): Review the chapter on NLP, marked with 'OAL', which covers topics such as:
            - Challenges
            - Transformers
            - Pipeline()
            - Zero-shot classification
            - Text generation 
        - Finish the two workshop exercises, worth 5% each.
        - The learning materials are available in Google Colab:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GBtVW1UFvRNLFZ9glgvxd0yBGZa-vja2?usp=drive_link
        - Important: Please complete all these tasks independently before the next lesson. 
        - If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out!

        Assessment Components
         The breakdown of assessment is as as follow:
        - 2 individual workshop exercises is worth 5% each
        - 2 individiual assignments is worth 20% each
        - 1 capstone group project is worth 30%
        - Class participation is worth 20%

        Attendance
        - QR code will be shown to students in the morning and afternoon to take attendance.
        - Students are expected to fulfill 80% of the attendance.
        - For valid absences, students will submit an official excuse letter to CETA and keep the trainer informed.

        Course overview
        - This course requires basic knowledge in Python programming.
        - Students will learn to create AI solutions using different pre-trained AI models to solve real world problems.
        - Students will learn to create solutions for text generation, sentiment analysis, question and answering, summarization, image classification and object detection. 
        - The concepts of Natural Language Processing, transformers, large language models is covered in the course.
        - Students will be using Google Colab as the coding platform throughout the course. 
        - The pre-trained AI models will be called from HuggingFaceðŸ¤—.

        When creating a quiz, it should
        - always begin your conversation by asking which topic the user would like to quiz.
        - contain different levels of difficulty.
